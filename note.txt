CDN link as below to bring React and React DOM in the project
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

instead of this have react in package.json So we don't need to
1. make addition call to get it in the application
2. take care of versions or upgrade.

#npm install react (not #npm install -D react,
     as we don't want it as dev dependency, we want it as normal dependency)

==============
NPM vs NPX
NPM is used to install some package like 
#npm install parcel [parcel is pkg name]

NPX is used to execute package like
#npx parcel index.html
